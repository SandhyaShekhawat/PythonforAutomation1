"""
What does the ** operator do in Python, and how is it used?

The ** operator is used for exponentiation, which means raising a number to the power of another number.
It is used to perform power operations in mathematical expressions.

"""
# Example
result1 = 2 ** 3
print(result1)  # Output: 8

result2 = 4.0 ** 0.5
print(result2)  # Output: 2.0

result3 = 2 ** -2
print(result3)  # Output: 0.25
"""
Integer and Floating-Point Results: The ** operator can handle both integer and floating-point numbers as the base and exponent.
 It will return a floating-point result if the exponent is not an integer.

 Exponentiation with Parentheses: Parentheses can be used to group operations and control the order of operations:

result = (2 + 3) ** 2
print(result)  # Output: 25

Complex Numbers: The ** operator also works with complex numbers:

result = (1 + 2j) ** 2
print(result)  # Output: (-3+4j)

In summary, the ** operator in Python is a powerful tool for performing exponentiation, allowing you to raise numbers to any power, whether positive, negative, or fractional.
