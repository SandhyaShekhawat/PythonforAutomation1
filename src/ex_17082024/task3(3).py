What does the ^ operator do in Python, and in what context is it commonly used?

The ^ operator is used for bitwise XOR (exclusive or) operations, not for exponentiation.
This operator works at the bit level and is used to perform a bitwise comparison between two integers.

What the ^ Operator Does:
Bitwise XOR Operation: The ^ operator compares each bit of its operands. If the corresponding bits of two operands are different, the result is 1.
If the bits are the same, the result is 0.

Syntax and Usage:
Syntax: a ^ b
Purpose: Performs a bitwise XOR between a and b.

"""

#Basic Bitwise XOR:
a = 10  # In binary: 1010
b = 4   # In binary: 0100
result = a ^ b
print(result)  # Output: 14 (In binary: 1110)


x = 15  # In binary: 1111
y = 8   # In binary: 1000
result = x ^ y
print(result)  # Output: 7 (In binary: 0111)


z = 7  # In binary: 0111
result = z ^ z
print(result)  # Output: 0 (In binary: 0000)

"""
Common Use Cases:
Bit Manipulation: The ^ operator is often used in low-level programming for tasks like setting, toggling, or clearing specific bits in a binary number.

Cryptography and Algorithms: XOR is used in various algorithms and cryptographic methods due to its properties.
For example, XOR is used in simple encryption schemes where a value is XORed with a key.


Finding Unique Elements: XOR can be used to find the unique number in an array where every other number appears twice. 
This is due to the property that
