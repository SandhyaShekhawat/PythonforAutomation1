"""
The above code will continue in case it is a even number divisible by 2 and will print the odd numbers in the range specified.

Continue and pass work in the similar fashion

But pass can be used with statements,functions,classes and objects.
continue cannot be used with functions,classes and objects.

For now they are performing skipping function.
Will learn about them later.
