# IndentationError:
# An Indentation error is a compile-time error that occurs when tabs or spaces in a code do not follow expected patterns.
# This is typically a syntax error.
# Indentation Error is a very common error in Python.
# Because Python is an interpreted language, its interpreter reads the code line by line.


#   print("hello world")--> A code statement starting from the space shows this error

# solution is select the file and reformat the code

print("hello world")

#To fix the indwntation error: rightclick on the program file and reformat
